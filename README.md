# MIDS Projects
#### Repository containing projects completed during University of California, Master of Information and Data Science program.

### Classifying Data Jobs: classify_data_jobs @ 1ecbdfc
•	Constructed supervised (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multinomial Naïve Bayes) and unsupervised (K-Means Clustering and Topic Modeling) learning models to identify distinguishing features in Glassdoor job listings to explain the relationship between data analyst, data scientist, and data engineer positions. 
•	Removed duplicates, converted categorical variables into dummy variables, and applied TfidfVectorizer to job descriptions. 

### Personalized Dialog Agent Without Persona Descriptions: persona_chatbot @ 26dabfb
•	Revised HuggingFace’s TransferTransfo model to learn personalities based on prior conversations instead of manually input personality descriptions. 
•	Tuned training and evaluation hyperparameters based on a function of the individual model heads on Google Cloud Platform. 
•	Conducted error analysis by randomly sampling misclassified dialogs to identify common mistakes and inform future models.

### Pandemic Fatigue Regression Analysis: ucb_mids_w203 @ e55225f --> lab_2-insert-team-name
•	Used datasets from states with stay-at-home orders to analyze whether people adhere to the orders less strictly over time. 
•	Selected relevant features by using data visualizations and EDA to identify trends and correlations between variables.
•	Evaluated the model against Classical Linear Model Assumptions and transformed variables to ensure accuracy of results.
•	Fitted three linear regression models to control for the marginal effects of confounding variables and found Order Length and Order Start Rank to be statistically significant at the 99.9% confidence level.

### Gender Bias in Science-Fiction Fantasy Literature: w241project_scifi @ b43e39b
•	Conducted an experiment by having MTurkers and university English departments read a science-fiction passage and fill out a Qualtrics survey regarding the main character’s perceived warmth and competence. 
•	Performed power calculations, t-tests and regression analysis on extracted data and found higher perceived competence for male characters compared to female.

### Coffee Review Visualization: https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~haleyfarber/index.html
•	Scraped textual data from coffeereview.com and cleaned review entries by extracting aroma descriptions, and systematizing location and price data using a foreign currency API.
•	Designed and implemented D3 and Tableau dashboards to allow users to filter by specific coffee roast features.
•	Conducted user studies by having participants complete sets of tasks and incorporated their feedback into the final website.
